# Super_Market_Sales_analysis
Goal:
Exploring the data and obtaining meaningful buisness insights

Work steps:
1. Load the file, make sure we dont need to deal with null values, converting time objects into "daytime" and use "info" method to explore the data.
2. Import qgrid and pivottablejs laybrerys in order to get initial intuition about the data and its features (the pivot ui reset every load).
3. Import sqldf from pandasql in order to create mini data frames faster that each one of them will be analized separately.
4. Using pandas plots, matplotlib and seaborn laybrerys to create visualisation (pie, bar, area, line, box and some combinations).
5. Understanding the affect that each feature have on the buisness operations.
